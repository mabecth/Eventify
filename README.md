# Eventify
Android based app from the course DAT255 - Software Engineering.

##Vision
Our vision with Eventify revolves around integrating refugees into the swedish society and culture as well as improving their proficiency in the swedish language. Eventify is built upon the idea that social events are a great way to achive both of these goals. Eventify is an attempt to make an app of this category usable by everyone. The focus has been on developing an easy to use graphical user interface and minimizing the requirement of proficiency in the english language.
